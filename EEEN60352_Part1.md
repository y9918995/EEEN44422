## 1.1	Definition of smart grid and its main features, automated transcript 
Hi, I'm Alessandra Parisian.  
 
And this is the first video of Section 1 in this video.  
I will introduce the concept of smart grid its main features challenges and opportunities both the transmission distribution.  
Network perspectives will be covered.  
We will start with one question.  
What is a smart grid you will come across several different definitions when you seek for it.  
Here you might read to possible definitions of a smart grid one from the UK department for business energy and Industrial strategy more focus on the low carbon aspect and another one from the International Energy agency, which emphasized it's also the key aspect of the use of digital Technologies for power system operation and planning.  
There are any way key aspect you commonly find Margaret definitions, which are the use of information and communication Technologies control and the particular focus on the more Active consumer role.  
This last aspect is strongly linked to The crucial and more active role to be played by the distribution Network in a smarter grid these strong focus on distribution networks is motivated by the fact that they generally make up around 90.  
G % of the total electricity system and networks and a very large percentage of all electrical demand and renewable generation is connected to the distribution networks trends that are expected to continue in the future.  
Another key aspect of smart grid is the aim at achieving a trade-off in multiple targets which are the costs of electricity Supply emission reduction.  
Security of Supply or generation storage options along with consumer demand must be Co optimized in order to achieve an optimal trade off this picture put together the main components of a smart grid such as the consumer side systems and demand side Technologies, which are used to help manage electricity consumption at Industrial Service and residential level.  
These include Energy Management Systems energy storage devices smart appliances and distributed generation.  
Then we have electric vehicle charging infrastructure and generally energy storage systems both electrically and firmly based which can provide Power System.  
Ancillary services such as capacity Reserve big load shaving smart charging during low energy demand in this Can also see smart meters which enable a two-way flow of information providing consumers and utilities with data on electricity price and consumption.  
We also have renewable and distributed generation which encompasses large-scale at the transmission level medium scale at the distribution level and small-scale on commercial and residential buildings.  
This can present challenges from Fordham.  
Management and controllability of this resources and for operation of the system and we have and this is a very important role information communication Technologies and control systems which support monitoring optimal management of the overall grid prevention of system faults before they happen to take corrective action.  
Hence key features of a smart grid are as we can see on the Right side.  
There is the integration of renewable energy resources the adoption of electric vehicles and storage systems in general the improved system reliability on and optimize use of the available Diversified generation mix to enable more efficient system operation through the increased digitalization and automation of the power system and finally the more active role of consumers, which will provide Leti necessary to respond to both Peak demand and variable generation needs This features of a smarter grid will help the future Power Systems to address the energy challenges.  
They have to face in order to be more efficient in meeting the ever-increasing energy demand the integration of renewable and distributed energy resources will increase Supply volatility and make the load patterns less predictable and more uncertain.  
This will also lead to a decrease in the marginal prices and Geez in the resource operational patterns as we will see in the next section.  
The Margaret will address these challenges through automation of generation and demand control and improved Energy Efficiency.  
Consumer service outages are often caused by distribution system failures The increased penetration of renewable energy sources pose a hypothesis a further threat to the grid reliability moreover as the grid becomes more digital cybersecurity is a further challenge to the grid reliability because of utilities and consumers data security a smarter grid as tawdry.  
These challenges by providing tools for tracking distribution and amount and forecasting possible losses detecting and responding as well as preventing Falls outages and possible attacks both physical and cyber attacks.  
The electricity industry does not have an effective mechanism for sharing information on cybersecurity yet and cybersecurity must be considered as part of a larger smart grid strategy Additional challenges Energy Systems face are limited grid capacity and aging infrastructure as demand grows and changes for example through deployment of electric vehicles aging distribution and transmission infrastructures will need to be replaced and updated and new technologies will need to be deployed the possible benefits.  
The smart grid Technologies may bring in response is the To maximize the use of existing infrastructure through better monitoring and management while new infrastructure can be more strategically deployed electricity system infrastructure is traditionally designed to meet the highest level of demand so during no non-peak times.  
The system is typically under utilized smart grids can reduce Peak Demand by providing information and incentives to Consumers.  
To enable them to shift consumption away from periods of peak demand the optimal management of peak demand can enable integration of new loads such as electric vehicles and storage deployment while maintaining existing Technologies.  
Lastly as Margaret can provide also viable solutions to reduce energy costs and Emissions smart grids can support greater deployment of clean.  
Analogies by providing operators with real-time system information that enables them to manage generation demand and power quality does increasing system flexibility and maintaining stability and balance in the smart grid consumers are more informed and help balance supply and demand by modifying the way the use and by electricity through the take-up of smart meters and smart appliances.  
All these combined.  
And we demand side response measures hands costs to Consumers are reduced through savings on network investment.  
in order to address all these energy challenges and Miss Martin future Power Systems have to be more flexible flexibility is the capability of power system to modify production or consumption in the face of rapid and large balances such as unpredictable fluctuations in demand or invariable generation, like wind and solar a significantly Diversified resource mix will be Art in order to support future power system operation resources that contribute flexibility are dispatchable generators demand-side management and energy storage facilities.  
We will discuss flexibility in Section 3 consumers are expected to play a considerably greater role in a smart grid deployment and it is crucial to boost their warnings of this more active role in a smarter grid consumers have choices which involve new technologies new information and new forms of electricity pricing and incentives smart meter systems and demand side technologies will provide consumers with more accurate information.  
One on their energy use and means to support power system operation suppliers will be able to offer more Dynamic rates that reward consumers for using energy at off-peak or generating energy at peak times to summarize.  
We can conclude that two of the key features of its Margaret are certainly the use of information communication Technologies and control systems.  
Us and the consumer involvement consumers need to understand what benefits they will achieve and how they change they have to change their behavior to gain those benefits.  
We do not know the best way to make this happen yet, but we do know the highly negative impact of take back and consumer backlash on future deployment plans.  
Thank you and see you at next video.

## 1.2	Drivers for smart grids, automated transcript 
Hi, I'm Alessandra Parisian.  
And this is the second video of Section 1.  
In this video.  
I will describe the main drivers of a smart grid and the energy.  
Trilemma.  
The sustainability aspect related to Smart grid will be discussed in this set of slides.  
We will discuss the main drivers of this transition towards a smarter.  
Grid.  
We will try to give an answer to this question.  
Can we keep on doing? Nessus usual, we start with.  
I lighting in this set of slides.  
We will discuss the main drivers of this transition toward a smarter grid.  
We will try to give an answer to this question.  
Can we keep on doing business as usual? We start with the highlighting that electricity's is the fastest growing component of total Global energy Demand, with consumption expected to increase by over 150 percent.  
Sent if no action is taken further.  
The International Energy agency has estimated that the transport sector will make up 10% of overall electricity consumption by 2050 because of a significant increase in electric vehicles.  
And penetration rates of variable generation increase over levels of 15 to 20% keeping business.  
As usual appears hardly possible.  
And usually expensive.  
Here are the main drivers for a change towards smarter power system are outlined.  
One driver, is the security of Supply, a possible solution for maintaining and improving the security of Supply in the face of rising demand and alter electric vehicle deployment is to use small sites generators, as well as storage facilities, integrated mainly at the distribution level and possibly renewable generation since Primary energy source is basically infinite.  
This way.  
We can increase the amount of generation capability on the system without needing to buy coal or gas from other countries or built large-scale expensive power plants.  
Most power system infrastructures and generation plants were built before or right after the World War 2.  
And we need to replace soon many of them.  
Smart grid Technologies, provide an opportunity to maximize the use of existing infrastructures through better monitoring and management.  
And in addition, new technologies are now available particularly low carbon Technologies, which can allow us to design the network.  
Friendly and operated more effectively.  
As mentioned before you have the Advanced Technologies are available.  
Not only renewable energy sources like wind and solar but also heat pumps.  
Electric vehicle storage devices, as well as information and communication technology think of computer, clusters mobile apps, sensors, and actuators networks.  
All these can enable us to control more effectively the system and change the way we operate.  
Sign it.  
These new technologies, represent new opportunities, but also new challenges.  
And we need to deal with that.  
Moreover.  
The adoption of Technologies, like combined heat and power.  
Plants can support both heat and electricity networks and optimize the overall capacity of energy infrastructure.  
Not only electricity infrastructure, the interaction with other energy carriers like heat and gas.  
Us might become a very valuable option and contribute to electricity system Services.  
We will further discuss this in Section 3.  
Markets are another important factor.  
The economics of the power system has been changing dramatically in the last 15-20 Years.  
Also, because of the deployment of variable generation technology, new services are to be enabled and so new markets, Regulators, operators owners and consumers need flexibility to modify the rules of business to suit operation Market.  
Decisions.  
Climate change is one of the main driver of smart grid mainly Europe United States.  
The main drivers is more the security of Supply.  
Since they had major blackouts in the last century in China.  
Instead.  
They are making huge investment in the system and they want to make it more intelligent and more cost-effective effort to reduce carbon emissions related to an end.  
Electricity generation and to reduce fuel Imports, have led to significant increase in the deployment of variable generation technology, like wind and solar climate change, is directly connected to sustainable electricity systems where low-carbon Technologies are integrated.  
This also motivates the choice of the unit title.  
Climate change is also the driver for sustainability.  
This picture shows how since 1950 there is a clear Trend in CO2 emissions, increase CO2, belongs to the category of greenhouse gases.  
And it is the most important because it is the one emitted.  
Most, there is now a global agreement that the carbon emissions CO2.  
Or carbon dioxide are the main cause of the global rise in the Hearth temperature.  
Anytime fossil fuel is burned to generate electricity, a certain amount of CO2 is generated, which is not the case.  
When natural resources like winners on our used carbon dioxide along with other greenhouse gases are in the atmosphere and at an optimal optimal level.  
They're creating sort of Shield that keeps the Earth at the temperature.  
We have now, without those gases, we would freeze, but if the level of gases increases, the Earth temperature would rise to, we need to reduce the level of greenhouse gases and reduce the temperature.  
One way to do.  
This is by reducing the amount of fossil fuel bird and producing energy by using carbon free or low carbon sources.  
Can sausage fuel Technologies, also contribute to sustainability.  
Let us Define sustainability, first.  
Sustainability is the ability of the system to endure and the it is a combination of environmental economic and social aspects.  
We need to cope with the growing pollution and greenhouse effect, the growing social need of the use of electricity and we need to make infrastructures more cost-effective so that all types of consumers can take advantage of them.  
This is a very classical Definition of sustainability, which tells that we need to use energy today so that our children will be able to use it tomorrow, the ever-increasing energy demand, and the climate change are putting this idea at risk.  
Can fossil fuel Technologies? Contribute to sustainability? Maybe not in the long term, but in the mid shorter, they could we will learn in the next sections that it's not possible, just to integrate into the power system, many renewable sources, we could not operate the system.  
That way.  
We have to think of a smarter way to realize decarbonization and we need to use renewable energy resources.  
With fossil fuel based Technologies.  
The sustainability is then a relevant aspect of future electricity systems and it is essentially related to the environmental Factor traditionally power system.  
Operation has been driven by the trade-off between make it cheap and secure which is the energy security dilemma in smart grids.  
The environmental aspect is included and we want to make the power system or so clean.  
This is what All energy.  
Trilemma.  
We want to make the power system, affordable, cheap secure and also clean this implies that we need to introduce in the power system, low-carbon Technologies to lower the missions.  
As concluding remark, we can say that.  
Smartness and sustainability go together in order to deliver smart and sustainable power system, and achieve the targets of a chips, clean and secure power system, several challenges are to be addressed, the introduction renewable sources and new electrical loads, like heat pumps and electric vehicles.  
Considerably challenge, the power system, traditional operation and design in addition.  
All electric storage, still an economical.  
We can work on technical aspects.  
But as long as there are not proper Market structures and mechanism, to incentivize and facilitate low-carbon Technologies.  
And as long as there are not new management tools for demand response, for instance, it smarter and sustainable power system.  
Cannot keep delivered.  
We can keep on with business, as usual.  
Oil and invest in traditional infrastructures are sets and generators, which is really expensive and not sustainable, or we can invest in smarter infrastructures, which are more based on intelligent control rather than assets.  
We need to understand how consumers can be part of these pictures.  
Thank you and see you at next video.

## 1.3	Conventional power system and smart grid
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the third video of Section 1.  
In this video the main differences between the conventional power system and a smart grid will be Illustrated.  
When the power system was created and built in the end of 19th century.  
The main challenge was to make it work.  
In the 20th century, the principal challenge has been to make the power system big in order to meet the growing energy demand.  
Hence, the huge infrastructures.  
We have today were built and that is why people Define the electrification as the greatest engineering achievement in the 20th century.  
This is the classic power system structure a conceptual schematic of a classical power system.  
In UK and generally in Europe.  
The power grid was mostly mostly developed after the World War II and the destruction it brought.  
And what we have today was basically built from scratch.  
The traditional power system was mainly based on large power plants large coal gas and nuclear plants because of the economy of scale.  
There is then the conventional generation and the generated electrical power is transported to passive consumers through high voltage transmission networks and the different voltage levels of the distribution Network.  
The power flow is unidirectional going from generation to consumption consumers are passive meaning that they do not participate to the operation of the system and do not participate in the energy Market.  
We will now outline the main features of a classical power system from generation to transmission and distribution of electricity.  
Has 2 generation there are mostly large power plants thermal based which means that fuels are burnt and it thermodynamical process going through several energy conversions steps is used to produce electricity.  
This conventional plants are provided with power system control.  
This implies that generators are controlled in order to supply different levels of power to meet different levels of electrical demand at any point in time.  
In a classical power system, what is controlled is the generation generators are controlled not all in terms of power flow, but also to provide ancillary services such as frequency response voltage regulation Reserve provision.  
A classical power system has a massive infrastructure of transmission Network generally meshed with fixed topology a transmission network is commonly very expensive as there are many redundant connections to guarantee security of Supply.  
If a problem occurs in 1 of the transmission lines, the power will be transmitted through another line path to guarantee that electricity is delivered to Consumers.  
Flow congestions are allowed which means that Network elements like links nodes can work at full capacity an element working at its full capacity cannot deliver any additional amount of power.  
And another element has to be used if needed or electricity has to be generated locally.  
When a classical power system is to be designed.  
There is a trade-off between the cost of allowed congestions and the investment cost since any additional capacity comes at high costs.  
As to distribution Network, there are multiple voltage levels and this is mainly because of the cost of infrastructures and power losses.  
It is convenient to have multiple voltage levels to minimize losses.  
A distribution Network.  
It is applied.  
What is called passive management by passive management.  
We basically mean that we do not have any control mechanism in the distribution Network.  
This also entails that control issues that might arise are to be resolved at the planning stage because of the lack of active control schemes in place potential issues are addressed by the signing a very large Network.  
So to prevent congestions in the distribution Network.  
Hands flow congestions are allowed only at the at the transmission level and the power system is actively controlled only by modulating the power produced by conventional generators.  
The powers flow is unidirectional from transmission to consumption.  
The demand is inelastic uncontrollable and not responsive in elastic means that the man does not respond to electricity prices consumers do not change then the way they use electricity based on the actual price of generating it.  
They will demand electricity when they need it or when they would like to have it also when it's not really necessary and it could be delayed think of a washing machine for instance in a classical power system.  
The demand is then uncontrollable.  
And just passively responds to signals from the grid of operator.  
Consumers do not participate actively to the operation of the power system.  
The current power system is being changed from the classical 1 the key difference is the better directional power flow since renewable energy sources and distributed generation is being integrated in the distribution Network and power flows also in the opposite direction upward.  
New sources of power which are not based on thermal power plants like wind and solar are integrated.  
There are mainly in the category of distributed generation, which basically means that small side generation plants are embedded in the distribution Network.  
These types of generators can be also connected to the transmission level think for instance of offshore wind farms.  
The other key aspect in the current power system is the active demand electrical demand is becoming more active and more responsive to Energy prices based on contracts, especially for industrial consumers.  
This is how a smart grid is likely to look like.  
We still have the fundamental blocks of a classical power system, but there are new technologies embedded in the network electric vehicles and electric heat pumps for instance.  
Further the man is becoming more active and responsive on top of these more advanced control schemes are to be integrated also in the distribution network.  
Not only in the transmission Network in order to control the distribution Network.  
The power system is to be increasingly monitored.  
We can see that smart meters adoption in houses is a very first step towards smart grids.  
It is essential to understand the behavior of these new technologies within the distribution Network and the opportunities and challenges that will rise from them.  
It is important to understand also how the electricity system interacts with other energy sectors like gas heat and also transport.  
This marking of the electricity grid is a progressive and revolutionary process is agreed does not become smart or smarter in 1 single step.  
This happens over time through an evolutionary process incremental changes and improvements in the system will take place gradually typically over decades.  
distributed generators will play a more active role in meeting local energy demand consumers through demand management will play a more active role in helping to balance supply and demand however in the short term distribution Network operators face some of the greatest challenges.  
The traditional distribution Network operator will evolve from its current role managing a largely passive Network to operating as a distribution system operator supporting local balancing and system optimization.  
The traditional passive role of the distribution Network operator must evolve such that distribution Network becomes more actively managed taking advantage of opportunities afforded by flexible demand distributed generation and energy storage to support efficient Network operation.  
This will require Network operators deploy new tools to allow them to better manage supply and demand at the local level.  
However, different settings will be around the world and deployed at different rates the user information and communication technology to Monitor and actively control generation and demanding near real time is a common feature.  
The energy pyramid gives an idea of useful actions that could be taken to contribute to a smarter and more sustainable energy grid energy conservation, which is consumed less reduced demand Energy Efficiency, which is minimizing the energy use by keeping the same level of service and the penetration of renewable energy sources into the power system.  
Concluding remarks of this first section are that the future power system will need to deliver not only cost effective and secure electricity, but also reduce emission.  
Embedding renewable and distributed generation combined with active responsive demand and demand side technologies will lead to smarter power grid with that come several challenges, which we will cover in the next sections.  
Thank you.

## 1.4	Introduction to low carbon technologies
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the first video of the section 2.  
In this video the most relevant low-carbon technologies will be presented.  
In Section 1 we have discussed the main drivers of the transition toward the smarter grid and I have learned that a smart grid embeds new technologies particularly low carbon Technologies, which can allow us to design the network differently and operate it more effectively.  
Low carbon Technologies produce power with substantially lower amounts of carbon dioxide emissions than is emitted from conventional fossil fuel power generation.  
Low carbon Technologies include renewable Technologies whose primary fuel being son is an infinite resource carbon capture and storage High assist and combined cycle gas turbines and nuclear as well since the corresponding carbon emissions are significantly lower.  
It is well known that Europe including United Kingdom is legally bound to provide a given share of its energy needs 15% for the United Kingdom including 30% of its electricity.  
12% of its it and 10% of its transport fuel from renewable sources by 2020 and to deliver a carbon neutral power supply by 20150.  
It is then required to progressively make use of all available and economically sound low carbon and carbon free options when investing in power generation assets taking into account National energy policies.  
Let us have a quick look at the different types of renewable Technologies.  
Back in history.  
The first generation of renewable Technologies was developed in the 19th century right here in Manchester and it included Hydro power biomass combustion and geothermal power.  
the second generation of renewable Technologies was developed in the 17th and 80th.  
When the climate change was mostly investigated those Technologies include solar wind bio energy based Technologies.  
The third generation of renewable Technologies has been developed around 20 years ago and includes tides and waves based Technologies and concentrating thermal solar power.  
The figure in these slides show that the renewable electricity capacity and share of electricity generation is growing everywhere.  
Looking at the graph on the left side.  
We can see that for instance in the United Kingdom the generation from bio energy in 2017 was up by 23% of an year earlier from offshore wind up to 10% and that solar photovoltaic represented just over 32% of all renewable capacity at the end of 2017.  
On the right side we can see that the renewable electricity capacity is growing continuously worldwide with forecast to increase of 43% by 2022.  
Carbon capture and storage is a technology that can capture up to 90% of the CO2 emissions produced from the use of fossil fuel in electricity generation.  
It is a critical technology to allow the continued use of coal gas and other fossil fuels while achieving our ambitious environmental targets.  
It is a well understood and quite mature technology.  
The main barriers to its deployment are its large scale integration into the grid its high costs and the reduction in the overall efficiency of the conventional plants due to the additional energy needed to run the carbon capture and Storage.  
The combined cycle gas turbines seem to be a key technology, especially in the United Kingdom to progress in the transition towards a smarter and clean electricity Grid at least in the short term in the next 2 decades.  
These types of turbines are more flexible than conventional gas turbines or coal and nuclear plants.  
Besides they use both the gas and steam turbines to produce up to 50% more electricity from the same fuel than a traditional gas turbine.  
It works to produce electricity and capture waste Heat.  
from the gas turbine to increase efficiency and electrical output in Section 1 we have learned that a smart grid has to embed also knew loads and contribute to the to the carbonizing also the Heat and transport sector.  
This new loads are heat pumps and electric vehicles which are additional loads that the electricity grid must balance.  
It is not all about electricity then.  
This picture shows a Sankey diagram of the use of energy United Kingdom in 2016.  
A Sankey diagram is a specific type of flow diagram in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.  
We can see that the energy demand from for the Heat and transport sectors are massive.  
And that demand is mainly met by petrol and gas based sources.  
Heat pumps and electric vehicles are the main technologies that can help meet our environmental targets through the use of clean electricity also to meet the energy demand for for transport and Heat.  
We can observe the similar trend of a significant share of the overall energy demand for transport and heat also worldwide as shown by the sanki diagram from the International Energy agency.  
As mentioned before heat pump is 1 technology to transfer electricity into heat besides simple electrical heaters.  
The 2 main types of heat pumps are air source heat pumps and ground Source heat pumps depending on the use heat source.  
We will discuss this further in the video electrification of heating and heat pumps.  
Electric vehicles are the main technology for the carbonizing the transport sector the main types of electric vehicles are battery electric vehicles fuel cell electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles.  
We will discuss this further in the video electrification of transport and electric vehicles.  
Since we cannot operate the power system where both transport and heat sectors are just completely electrified in the same way.  
We cannot simply replace all the existing power plants with renewable generators.  
We need ICT and Innovative control and management tools to use all these new technologies in the most efficient way.  
We will see in Section 3 that new sources of flexibility are available in a smart grid and use of those flexibility sources can help address the challenges of the energy trilemma.

## 1.5	Impact of LCT on the energy market
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the third video of the section 2.  
This video looks at the energy market and will explain why the energy Market needs to change in order to support penetration of renewable energy sources.  
This figure provides a simple illustration of how the electricity market and generally commodity Market works.  
The demand of Supply curves of a commodity the electricity in our case are estimated based on the cost of production of an additional unit, which is the marginal cost of production and the willingness of consumers to buy the commodity.  
The market clearing price is the point where the 2 curves intersect and represents the balance between supply and demand.  
The market and clearing price is the marginal cost of the system to produce the transacted quantity.  
The market price is the price of the last unit sold and this is set by the marginal producer.  
Any other producers selling on the market is called in for marginal producer.  
Extra marginal producers are the ones whose producing costs are higher than the market price and cannot sell.  
This figure depicts the prophet of an informal producer.  
Notice that the electricity demand is still quite inelastic, which means that the man does not really respond to prices.  
In from marginal producers sell at Price higher than their marginal cost of production, which is the cost to produce an additional Mega Tower of electricity since the marginal cost of the considered in from marginal producer is represented by the dashed black line.  
The economic profit is the green area.  
This profit can be used to recover investment fixed cost for instance.  
On the other end the marginal producer is paid as it beats, which is exactly its marginal cost representing variable costs.  
A marginal producer than does not make any profit.  
A producer cannot be a marginal producer to often.  
Otherwise, it will be not possible to cover its fixed costs.  
under certain conditions It is allowed to some producers to include in their beats, not only variable costs, but also part of their fixed costs in order for them to stay in the market.  
This is valid for instance for Pickers more expensive plants used to cover pick demand.  
In an electricity Market with variable generation baseload plants such as coal and gas based plants might be marginal producers more often.  
Let us consider a simple example to show this.  
The figure illustrates a market sketch with 5 generators nuclear coal plants combined and open cycle gas turbines and Diesel plant.  
Which bid on the market? Let us consider a simple example to show this.  
The figure illustrates a market sketch with 5 generators nuclear and cold plants combined and open cycle gas turbines and a diesel plant.  
Which bid on the market.  
These are the respective marginal costs and maximum capacities.  
These are quite realistic numbers for the sake of simplicity at zero minimum stable generation is assumed.  
We consider 3 specific hours and respective demand levels 3:00 a.m.  
Blue vertical line 11 a.m.  
Green vertical line and 6 p.m.  
The plants are dispatched according to their Merit order.  
Which is from the lowest to the highest marginal costs.  
Of course the maximum capacities of each generator must be taken into account.  
Without variable generation.  
The nuclear is always in from argenal producer coal is a marginal producer only at 3:00 a.m.  
To cover the demand at 11:00 a.m.  
Nuclear and cold plants are needed which can produce up to 1 gigawatt while the combined cycle gas turbine can produce the remaining 200 megawatt and be the marginal producer.  
At 6 p-m the more expensive open cycle gas turbine is needed as well to cover the daily Peak demand.  
We can notice that the marginal cost of the whole system which is the marginal cost of marginal producer changes with time.  
Consider the scenario with 300 megawatt of variable generation.  
From wind and solar plants for instance.  
The marginal costs of wind turbines and solar plants is basically zero since wind and sun come for free.  
And there is a little bit of Maintenance costs anyway to consider.  
The maximum capacity is the maximum generation available at the point in time which depends on the wind speed and solar radiation available at that point in time.  
For the sake of Simplicity.  
Let us assume.  
We have 300 megawatt of variable renewable generation at 3:00 a.m.  
11:00 a.m.  
And 6:00 p.m.  
We dispatch again the valuable generators based on their Merit orders.  
And we noticed that nuclear is a marginal producer at 3:00 a.m.  
Coal is not used at 3:00 a.m.  
And the peaker open cycle gas turbine is never utilized.  
If this situation happens often, the open cycle gas turbine will not be able to cover its costs and will go out of the market but open cycle gas turbine could be still needed to cover pick the month when variable renewable generation is is much lower than expected.  
New Market structures are needed for instance capacity markets which consider megawatt and not megabat Towers to address this issue.  
We can also notice that the market prices are reduced for instance from 50 pounds per megawatt hour to 20 pounds per each megawatt hour of electricity generated.  
The electricity price becomes then more volatile and then uncertain it does not only depend on the demand and the time of the day, but it can be different even if the level of demand is the same with the integration of variable renewable generation.  
It is not possible to know in advance the marginal cost of the power system, even if the demand can be accurately predictive.  
In this slide, we now consider a slightly more complicated scenario with a minimum stable generation of 500 megawatt for the nuclear plant, which implies that the nuclear plant must always produce 500 megawatts.  
In addition, there are other technical constraints for each specific technology to be taken into account.  
In this example, we consider minimum up time for the new clear and cold plants.  
Meaning that once turned on those plants are to stay on for at least 24 hours and 5 hours respectively.  
Those plants have been previously on for 12 hours and 3 hours respectively.  
So they are must run generation for the minimum load condition of 800 megawatt.  
This implies that 200 megawatt of renewable generation must be curtailed and lost.  
This issue can boost the use of storage systems to store renewable generation overnight and use it during peak times.  
This would change the way we operate the system and also the electricity Market This slide summarizes the main effects of variable energy generation we have discussed.  
The presence of specific policies designed to support the deployment of renewable Technologies such as feed in tariffs.  
Could contribute to the currents of negative power prices basically to be paid for consuming electricity in the electricity markets and thus increase the revenue losses of existing generation.  
Negative prices can occur because renewable sources would rather accept a negative price than give up production or in flexible generators such as nuclear and coal plants may prefer to continue to operate rather than shutting down.  
Renewable generators can be on the market with negative prices and formally ensured to be dispatched and not curtailed.  
This could lead to interesting games with coal plants for instance negative price signals can also prove useful if well implemented they deliver a signal to all generators that increase flexibility is necessary.  
Thank you.

## 2.1	Impact of LCT on the long-term security
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the second video of the section 2.  
This video provides a description of the main challenges introduced by the penetration of variable renewable energy sources from a planning perspective.  
Variable renewable energy is a renewable energy source, that is not dispatchable due to its fluctuating nature like wind power and solar power ah suppose to a control but renewable energy source such as hydro electricity or biomass.  
In this video, we will focus on planning and then long-term security requirements.  
The long-term security is defined in terms of generation adequacy, which is the capability to meet the man with a certain level of reliability of supply.  
There are several metrics to measure this reliability of the power system 1 common metric is the loss of load probability, which is the probability of peak demand to exceed available generation.  
This allows planning the capacity margin of the system, which is the excess installed capacity about expected Peak demand probability.  
The loss of load probability must be as Loose as possible a probabilistic model of the available generators based on the capacity outage probability table is used to estimate the capacity margin required to obtain the loss of load probability lower than a given threshold.  
The capacity outage, uh probability table is based on a simple on of model of conventional generators considering the probability that a specific generators goes offline.  
Since also the conventional generation is intermittent.  
A probability is associated to each state of each thermal generator for instance 85% on and 15% off.  
This figure provides a graphical interpretation of the capacity.  
Margin.  
It shows the probability of having a given load represented by the black curve and the probability of having a certain generation the blue curve considering the probabilistic on half model of generators.  
It would be desirable to have the blue curve as far as possible from the black curve in order to prevent risk of insufficient generation.  
The more generators are planned in the system.  
The more the blue curve is shifted to the right.  
This of course would come at high costs.  
The difference between installed capacity of generation Fleet and the peak gives the capacity margin of the system.  
The capacity margin is calculated such that the loss of load probability is lower than a given threshold.  
the higher the capacity margin is the lower the loss of a load probability is in the United Kingdom a loss of load probability of 9% is usually required.  
Since the peak demand commonly occurs in winter.  
This means that 9 winter in 100 years the peak demand could be not covered.  
This corresponds to a capacity margin of 24% considering average failures rates of 85% Other countries might have different criteria such as Island which requires an expected loss of load probability of 8 hours per Anum.  
The loss of load probability of 9% implies in the United Kingdom that 15 gigawatts per capacity to provide security of Supply is required.  
Since the expected Peak demand is round 5556 GB.  
This graph shows the loss of load probability against the capacity margin.  
We can see that if we have the capacity margin the loss of load probability increases to 90% if the expected Peak demand increases and then additional capacity would be required.  
Another possible solution is demand side management.  
For example, the system operator can contract load shedding with some consumers which are preventive and not corrective actions.  
We will describe this in Section 3 If variable renewable generation is introduced into the power system a similar probabilistic model can be considered in order to estimate the capacity margin.  
the model of variable renewable generator cannot consider only 2 possible States But more than 2 States each 1 with its Associated probability as shown in this figure where we have 3 states, for example.  
In order to measure the contribution from variable renewable generation to the long-term security and the capacity.  
Margin.  
The capacity credit is used.  
The capacity credit is a measure of the amount of load that can be served on an electricity system by variable plant with no increase in in the loss of load probability.  
The question is can some of the conventional generation capacity be replaced with renewable generation without any increase in the loss of load probability.  
1 of the main factors contributing to capacity credit is the degree of correlation between the peak load and the power output of this variable sources.  
For instance if the peak load occurs in summer in a Sunny Country solar generation is highly correlated to the peak load and it can have a high capacity credit.  
Diversity of renewable sources is another important factor that can improve their capacity credit.  
for instance It is more likely that renewable generation is available when a peak load occurs, if the installed renewable capacity is not concentrated in a single geographical area, but spread across many different regions.  
Having a portfolio of diverse types of renewable energy sources improves the capacity credit, too.  
The third relevant Factor contributing to capacity credit is the average level of output the higher the Renewable Power output is the more likely is that renewable generation can contribute to the peak load.  
This figure shows the capacity credit of wind generation for several countries.  
as the store capacity of wind generation increases we can see that wind power May displays relatively small conventional capacity which decreases as the wind penetration increases at very low penetration rates the capacity credit of variable generation varies in a wide range mostly reflecting the correlation of their output with Peak demand.  
While capacity credits for Wind plans for lower level of penetration are usually close to their capacity factor, which can be 40% those for solar plants can vary in a wide range.  
from 38% to close to zero the capacity credit of variable renewable decreases with the penetration level.  
The more renewable generation is present in the system the more often Peak net load results from meat.  
Because additional renewable generation is correlated with the existing 1 adding more to the system will do little to increase output during these hours.  
This effect is also Illustrated in this figure for solar capacity.  
Any additional increase of solar capacity has no effect in reducing the residual net load Peak.  
Because of low capacity credit it will be necessary to retain a significant proportion of conventional plant to ensure that the security of Supply is maintained.  
Renewable Rich systems will feature an increasingly large capacity.  
Margin which exceeds the demand by significant amount.  
In this example, we consider a power system with a peak demand of 30 gigabytes.  
Purely based on conventional generation and the capacity margin of 25% which corresponds to 7.5 gigabytes.  
If 30 gigabytes of wind capacity are installed.  
Only 3.5 gigabytes of commercial capacity can be displayed and the total install capacity is 64 gigabytes almost doubled.  
This implies that the capacity margin which is the difference between these 2 capacity and the expected Peak demand significantly increases with respect to the power system without wind generation.  
in conclusion variable renewable generation tend to have a lower contribution to the generation and the equity and long-term security then dispatchable plants because all a fraction of their potential output is certain to be available at times of peak demand.  
As a result other resources are needed in the system to compensate for the lower contribution to a day and to maintain the targeted reliability level of the system.  
The low capacity credit of variable generation will be reflected in a need to also invest in resources to ensure reliability such as dispatchable generation demand side response grid capacity and storage system.  
Thank you.

## 2.2	Impact of LCT on the short-term security
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the 4 video of the section 2.  
The video provides a description of the main challenges introduced by the penetration of renewable energy sources from a short-term security perspective.  
concerns have emerged on how adequate level of security of Supply in a smart grid is mainly due to the rapid development of renewable Technologies.  
Solar and wind based Technologies depend on meteorological conditions and can pose significant challenges to balance generation and consumption in and close to real time which refers to the short-term security.  
In order to operate the power system correctly, the supply demand balance has to be maintained at any point in time.  
Otherwise, the frequency of the system will be not constant.  
And excess load causes a drop in frequency and excess generation causes an increase in frequency.  
If this excesses are Beyond given thresholds and last too long generator Protection Systems will trip which would create further imbalances and cascading failures in the system.  
This implies that generators can only operate within a narrow range of frequencies and frequency deviations must be corrected quickly.  
We have constantly fluctuations in load and generation and generators embed control systems in order to continuously regulate the frequency.  
Major imbalances, which can be caused by sudden urges of generators and interconnectors are compensated by the signing correctly spinning or sending Resource as we will see in the next slides.  
The additional uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources complicates power system operation.  
In this slide examples of the main types of imbalances are Illustrated.  
We consider 5 periods which correspond to different periods in the electricity market usually with the time resolution of 13 minutes.  
We can see that there are continuous load fluctuations represented by Blue Line slower low fluctuation represented by the red line, which provide the current of the imbalances and major imbalances like the 1 show by this green line.  
Due to the fact that the generation is changing substantially in a conventional power system based on thermal generation.  
This major imbalance is mainly due to some generators going offline in a system including renewable energy sources there could be other reasons like a sudden drop in the wind speed of or clouds or a sudden increase in the width speed such that the cutout speed of the winter binds is reached and the winter binds must be shut down.  
Ancillary and balancing services are in place to compensate for these imbalances and guarantee the power system continuously operates as you have seen in the unit 4 regulation Services, uh deal mainly with continuous load fluctuations load following Services cope with tracking the changes in the load and then handle intra period load fluctuations while Reserve services are designed to handle large and unpredictable imbalances.  
Traditionally balancing and ancillary Services have been provided by generators with their embedded Governors and control systems.  
However, the integration of renewable generation and the development of smart grid technologies have prompted a shift in the equipment that can be used to provide.  
Ancillary Services the more response.  
For instance, which we will discuss in Section 3 spinning Reserve is provided by synchronized plant Running part loaded.  
So that they can provide primary and secondary frequency response when needed and then return to the power level before the imbalance event occurred.  
As an alternative to spinning reserve the balancing tasks can and usually ease also supported by standing Reserve which is supplied by planned such as open cycle gas turbines with higher fuel costs.  
Regulation and load following services are quite predictable and preventive actions.  
It is expected that there are fluctuations in generation and demand.  
In a traditional power system.  
The demand is quite predictable.  
However in a smart grid with more variable generation and increase flexibility in the demand and new loads, like electric vehicles the uncertainty both in the generation and demand increases Reserve services are corrective actions.  
There are called upon by the system operator once the issue has occurred.  
In these slides the types of services to address the different types of imbalances.  
We have seen before are shown.  
A power system with renewable energy generation, uh faces several challenges to the short-term security and then to provide the balancing task.  
With higher penetration of variable renewable generators, like wind and solar generators and then more frequent and are predictable imbalances.  
The amount of reserved capacity required to securely operate the system increases and the larger number of plants are required to run part loaded, which is a loss also in terms of efficiency and investment.  
Synchronized Reserve is provided by conventional plant Run Part loaded with a consequent efficiency loss in the typical range between 10% and 20% the reduced efficiency a causes also an increase in costs and Emissions because more fuel is needed to generate the same amount of electricity.  
The amount of Reserve to be considered in order to compensate for major imbalances due also to the uncertainty in variable renewable generation depends on on several factors such as the magnitude of fluctuations to manage and the balancing time scales.  
variable generation depends on whether conditions like wind speed and solar radiation and the longer the forecast lead time is the higher the error in forecasts can be If the forecast lead time is for instance, 2 hours standing reserve put in place must comprise plans able to start up within that time.  
If the balancing time scale to consider is seconds the standing Reserve mentioned before is not a viable option.  
In addition the amount of spinning Reserve required to guarantee security of Supply also impacts the amount of renewable generation to bigger tailed the following simple example will illustrate this.  
We consider 26 gigawatt on restored Wing capacity.  
But the expected power output is 12 GB and the system operator has decided to schedule 6.5 gigawatt of Reserve.  
So 50% of expected output.  
These are realistic figures.  
The demand is 25 GB the inflexible generation capacity or mass run generation is 8.4 GB.  
Combined cycle gaster binds are available to provide spinning Reserve with 550 megawatt of rated power output and 300 megawatt as minimum stable generation.  
This means that each turbine can provide 250 megawatt of Reserve while running part loaded at its minimum stable generation.  
Standing Reserve is also available, which is provided by open cycle gas turbines up to 2 gigabytes.  
Extending Reserve is usually provided by more expensive but more flexible plans with for instance shorter startup times and higher Ramp rates.  
We will compare now to possible Reserve options.  
In this first scenario, we use only spinning Reserve provided by plants running part loaded synchronized with the grid.  
In order to provide the required 6.5 GB of Reserve 26 combined cycle gas turbines are needed.  
This implies that 26 units provide 300 megawatt each and then produce 7.8 GB.  
This capacity is to be added to the flexible generation capacity of 8.4 GB.  
Thus there is 28.2 GB of generation available in case the wind generation is equal to the expected 1 whilst the demand is 25 gigabytes.  
This entails that 3.2 gigawatt of clean and cheap generation must be curtailed.  
When generation has priority on the dispatch since it is assumed to have zero marginal cost.  
But it is technically V viable to reduce its output if required to maintain the supply demand balance.  
As an alternative to spinning Reserve.  
And as an option to mitigate the above issues.  
The balancing tasks can and usually is also supported by standing Reserve.  
Part of the reserve required to integrate 26 gigawatt of wind generation is now provided by standing Reserve open cycle gas turbines up to 2 gigabytes.  
The remaining 4.5 gigawatt will be provided by 18 combined cycle gas turbines spinning.  
The total available generation including the wind generation will be now, uh, 25.8 gigawatt with 800 megawatt of surplus to be curtail instead of 3.2 gigawatt.  
This is a summary to compare the 2 scenarios an optimized combination of standing and spinning Reserve can increase the penetration of variable renewable generation in the power system and then reduce the amount of fossil fuel burned.  
The capacity factor is the energy that can be produced by a generator as a percentage of that which would be achieved if the generator were to operate at maximum output 100% of the time.  
Capacity factors for base load thermal generators can be around 85% 90% in a traditional power system without variable renewable generation.  
1 turbines typically achieve capacity factors of 20% 40% depending on location the sign characteristics and weather conditions in a particular year.  
An illustration of the capacity Factor losses experienced by existing dispatchable plants following the introduction of a significant share of variable renewable generation is provided in this figure.  
A generation mix has been established to minimize the generation costs for a yearly load duration.  
Curve the black curve in the illustration in the absence of Abel renewable generation.  
Then a given amount of wind generation is added to the system providing 30% of the total electricity consumption.  
Because of the lower marginal cost of wind the net load curve seen by the dispatchable Technologies is shifted to a lower level the gray curve.  
The figure on the left shows the amount of load lost by conventional plants, which clearly corresponds to a reduce utilization or capacity Factor.  
Picking plants which are the plants generally more expensive used to cover pick demand are the most penalized.  
With a significant reduction of their maximal utilization time and of overall electricity production.  
At the penetration level considered in this example the production losses for picking plants can reach up to 80% of the level expected in the absence of variable renewable generation.  
Because of the infeed of low marginal cost electricity the supply curve shifts to the right as shown in the figure on the right side push pushing plants with higher marginal costs out of the market.  
The electricity Market can thus experienced a decrease of the number of hours in which Peak and mid load Technologies are marginal which results in lower spot and average electricity prices.  
notice that this example considers any inelastic demand To summarize we have described the challenges brought by the integration of variable renewable generation to short-term Security in particular an increase of required Reserve which leads also to a reduction of the capacity factor of conventional plants as well as of the efficiency and thus an increase in carbon emissions.  
1 possible solution is to optimally combine standing and spinning Reserve.  
We will see that the man flexibility and other sources of flexibility available in a smart grid can address this challenge.  
Thank you.

## 2.3	Impact of LCT on the power system operation
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the fifth video of section 2.  
This video provides a description of the main challenges introduced by the penetration of renewable energy sources from an operational perspective.  
As you have learned in unit 4 short-term power system operation focuses on how to run the system considering the existing system and available equipment generating units system components such as Lynx buses control devices load and forecasts of load and wind solar generation.  
The power system is traditionally operated such that it is first secure while economic operation comes next.  
In a smart grid the environmental aspect plays also an important role because we aim at having a clean electricity, too.  
Several additional challenges must be addressed in order to guarantee efficient power system operation such as uncertainty related to large penetration of a renewable energy sources at both transmission and distribution levels new flexible and distributed generation Technologies such as combined heat and power plants and combined cycle gas turbines new loads and consumers with embedded generation and flexible loads.  
In addition.  
We will see that in order to achieve the targets of a more sustainable energy use and the Carbonite the Heat and transport sectors a smarter electricity grid must also take the interaction with other energy sectors into account.  
Traditionally power system operation is based on optimization problems.  
As you have learned in unit 4 economic dispatch unit commitment and optimal power flow.  
However with a new challenges smart grid face new optimization and management tools are needed and the traditional operation optimization is not longer effective.  
The traditional economic dispatch is a short-term optimization problem in particular.  
It is the process of deciding the power output.  
It generating unit should produce at any point in time in order to minimize the running costs of the poor power system given an aggregated demand level and already committed generating units with their power capacity.  
In the economic dispatch, the networks constraints are not including included and the single note Network approximation is applied.  
Since the objective is to minimize the costs the cost of producing power per each generating unit is to be included in the power in the problem formulation.  
In the figure on the right side a typical generation cost curve is shown.  
It is generally approximated as a quadratic curve, but could also be a linear cost function which would imply having a constant marginal cost? If a a cost and marginal cost per each generating unit is assumed.  
Solving the economic dispatch problem results in a priority list of the committed generating units which are dispatched then according to their sign Merit depending on their generation costs.  
The generating units are dispatched from the cheapest to the most expensive 1.  
the mathematical theory behind the solution of this optimization problems is based on the LaGrange multipliers and the kkt conditions as you have seen in unit 4 the demand is generally cyclical with low levels of load at of peak times usually overnight or early morning.  
And high low levels at peak times usually in late afternoon.  
Since the electricity must be available when required this results in a Time varying cost of producing electrical energy depending on the load level and then the time of the day.  
I would like here just to mention that in power system with high penetration of variable renewable energy sources the load profile will change and will be not so predictable.  
The net load is to be mainly considered which is the total electrical demand minus the renewable generation.  
In this figure is clearly shown that when the load level is low as at around 6 a.m.  
Only the cheapest generating units are dispatched and the marginal cost of the overall power system is low while when the aggregated load level is high as at around 1:00 p.m.  
Also the most expensive generating units need to be dispatched and the cost of generating electrical energy for the overall power system increases, too.  
Notice that consumers do not really see the cost of electricity they buy changing every hour or half an hour.  
The cost of energy delivered to the end users is usually closer to the average cost of electricity in a smart grid.  
This will change electricity prices will be more than damick and time varying also for consumers who will be also able to participate in the energy market and sell electrical energy.  
Further in a smart grid the demand must be more elastic than responsive to the price signals.  
So that aggregated load profiles more effective in supporting.  
The grid operation can be shaped for instance by moving part of the consumption from Peak to off peak times.  
The economic dispatch problem assumes that n generating units are already committed and then running we need another optimization problem to decide which generating units available in the power system should be committed and when over a given shuling writen for for example over 1 day the unit commitment problem considers all the existing generating units, we uh with their specific Technical and operational constraints, including the intertemporal ones and the aggregated load profile over 1 day.  
The economic dispatch is a sub problem of the unit commitment.  
In the unit commitment intertemporal constraints must be accounted for since it is the process of deciding which unit units should be committed and how much they should generate to meet the aggregated load at minimum cost over a given time Horizon.  
Thus for instance minimum up and down times are to be included in the problem formulation.  
Scenes, especially the thermal base conventional power plants cannot be shut down or started up at any time.  
But once they are on they must stay on for a given time and once they are shut down they must stay off for a given time.  
Further Ramp rates constraints must be taken into account since in 1 time period for instance half an hour generating units cannot ramp up to any power output level.  
Additional cost terms are to be added to the cost function to minimize such as startup and shutdown costs.  
The unit commitment problem formulation also includes additional system related constraints such as limits on emissions and Reserve constraints to cope with uncertainty coming from the intermittent intermittency of conventional plants and the variable renewable generation and guarantee security of supply.  
The amount of Reserve depends on the level of risk the system operator decides to take The unit commitment is an important optimization tool for power system operation because it allows including relevant intertemporal constraints and compensating through reserved for Planned outages and power imbalances.  
However, the problem formulation involves integer decision variables and it is a mixed integer problem, which is known as being NP hard meaning it is um, at least as hard as any non-deterministic polinomial time problem.  
It is then not an easy problem to solve.  
Since in practice generating units and loads are not all connected to the same bus the obtain power dispatch can result in unacceptable line flows or voltages into the electrical Network.  
Interconnectors power lines in a network have a limited capacity voltage values must be must be in a given range an optimal power flow problem has to be solved in order to compute the feasible schedule of the generating units in case the economic dispatch solution is not acceptable.  
The optimal power flow is an extension of the economic dispatch which accounts for the network operating limits the power flow equations the Power Balance at each node and limits on the various decision variables.  
It is a more challenging problem to solve because it is formulated as a large scale mix integer nonlinear optimization problem.  
In a smarter grid additional constraints objective and challenging aspects must be accounted for in order to optimize the operation of the grid.  
Besides what we have mentioned so far such as plant outages or Technical and operational constraints and Power Balance at each node, the new optimization tools for a smarter Grid or operation must take into account other components such as storage devices with their specific Dynamics and characteristics new loads such as heat pumps and electric vehicles.  
The mansson management to optimally coordinate flexible loads in the grid such as heating ventilation air conditioning systems or smart appliances and to allow consumers to participate in electricity Market.  
Less predictable sources of uncertainty such as renewable generation electricity prices electricity demand Which is less predictable since consumers for example can own flexible loads or distributed renewable generation.  
Interaction with other energy sectors such as the heat sector, uh through for instance heat pumps and combined heat and power plants availability of large amount of data sensing and activating equipment and increased control over communication networks, which would allow closing the loop and taking advantage of feedback mechanisms to compensate for unforeseen events and reopened more often, uh over shorter time scales based on more accurate forecasts and more updated measurements and information from the system.  
Lastly multiple objective cost functions are to be optimized not only running costs and power losses, but also emissions and grid support services for instance.  
Thank you.

## 2.4	Electrification of heat
Hi, I'm Alessandra Parisian.  
And this is the seventh video of section 2.  
This video describes the heat pump Technologies, and the challenges, and opportunities of electrification of heating as shown in these Sankey diagram of the energy flows in the United Kingdom in 2016.  
The heat sector shows a significant portion of the energy use a Smart future electricity.  
He needs to cope with new loads light heat pumps who's utilization is increasing and which can help the carbonizing, the heat sector the carbonizing.  
The heat sector is recognized as one of the biggest challenges for the electric grid.  
In the United Kingdom.  
The renewable heat incentive is a unit subsidy For Her Majesty's treasury, for producers of renewable heat which Support the following Technologies, biomass.  
Boilers air and ground Source.  
Heat pumps.  
Solar thermal participants in.  
Each scheme are paid Tarif per unit of energy produced.  
An electric heat pump is an alternative to the widely used gas boilers to produce heat.  
It is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it too.  
A warmer one that is why electricity is needed to perform this work.  
Many heat pumps can operate reversibly, that is for both Heating, in Winter and Cooling.  
In summer.  
When indoor environment needs to be cooled down.  
And heat is transferred again from a colder to a warmer.  
Ambient.  
There are two main types of electric heat pumps the pending or on the heat Source Hair Source, heat pump with the outside are serving as a heat source and ground Source, heat pump.  
Where heat is absorbed from the ground, or ground water rather, than from the are.  
Depending on the way, heat is distributed.  
There might be hot water Distribution Systems are distribution.  
Stems.  
And so on, in order to assess the performance of heat pumps in third, in terms of energy.  
Use the coefficient of performance is adopted as metric, which is the ratio of the heat generated to the electricity needed to generate that amount of heat and represent and efficiency measure the thermal Source from which free heat is extracted.  
Plays a crucial role.  
Roll in terms of heat pump performance.  
In fact the greater the temperature difference between the Heat source and the heat sink is.  
The more energy is needed to compress the fluid.  
Thus the coefficient of performance decreases with increasing temperature difference.  
The higher is the difference.  
The lower is the coefficient of performance, the ground Source, heat pump is generally more efficient than the air.  
Heat pump since the ground temperature is more constant and at round eight, eleven degrees.  
Also, in Winter for real applications, actual coefficient of performance values, vary between 2 and 4 Hair Source.  
Heat pumps in Winter food, stamps are less efficient and might even stop working.  
When the outdoor temperature drops too much.  
In case of cooling, the metric is the The ratio of cooling to the electricity needed to generate that amount of cooling and it is called Energy, Efficiency ratio.  
Electric heat pumps are important in order to decarbonize the electricity grid, but of course, cleaner energies should be used again through the higher penetration of low-carbon Technologies.  
However, the represent additional loads which put extra stress on the electricity Grid.  
In this figure.  
We can have an idea of the seasonal impact over heat pumps integration into the electricity Grid in the United Kingdom.  
The electricity consumption is quite constant over the month while gas consumption increases in Winter for heating.  
Thus the electrification of heating through electric heat pumps would lead to the creation of considerable Peaks during winter.  
While during summer, the electricity use is not much affected.  
This would have an impact also in terms of network infrastructure and generation capacity additional.  
Power plants are needed to generate would be needed to generate electricity.  
But their utilization Factor will be low because they are mainly needed during winter.  
You will study the impact of these additional loads on the distribution network, from a technical perspective, in terms of voltage stability.  
In the last three sections of the unit, in the figure of, on the left side.  
We can have an idea of the daily impact of Pump pumps integration into the electricity Grid in the United Kingdom.  
The figure shows that the main heat pump, daily load profile.  
In Winter has two peaks.  
The morning Peaks is usually higher in power and shorter in duration than the evening peak.  
In the figure on the right side, the difference in the demand profile between a scenario without heat pumps and a 20% hit.  
It pump deployment scenario is shown.  
It can be seen that the heat pump load has added most to the morning and it's beginning to create morning peak in addition to the evening peak in the grid load at 20% deployment of heat pumps.  
This effect is not very strong and it would be stronger at higher deployment scenarios.  
In order to cope with these higher electrical loads, a new Peak load.  
The system should be operated.  
Optimally to try to flatten out the demand.  
Curve over both the year and the day and then shift part of the consumption from peak times, two periods of lower demand demand side management schemes to take advantage of the flexibility in the electrical demand can help, but it is the heat demand that must be shifted and optimally managed to be really able to integrate electric heat pumps into the grid.  
And level out the resulting total electrical demand.  
Thermal storages.  
Can be employed, for instance, to store heat during night and use the stored heat during the day.  
In order to reduce the peak load due to the heat demand power to heat schemes are increasingly.  
As promising options to support the deck urbanization of the heat sector and the smartening of the electrical grid by taking advantage of the interaction between the electricity and heat sectors power to heat.  
Generally represents the use of electricity typically coming from renewable energy.  
Otherwise curtailed to produce useful heat.  
That could in case be stored power to heat.  
Can support more flexible and efficient operation of the power system and additional renewable.  
Energy integration, the scheme.  
Illustrated in this light, represent a quite Advanced power to heat scheme where there is a typical District heating system and the large-scale combined heat and power plant.  
A CHP along with heat pumps and thermal storage has four exams electric heat pumps can be At times when there is renewable generation in order to use clean energy, otherwise curtail which of course reduces the electricity import from the grid this optimally coordinated with combined heat and power.  
Plants can support electrification of heat and increase the penetration of variable renewable energy combined heat and power.  
Plants are usually driven by the heat demand.  
However, they also Produce electricity.  
This can create a significant excess.  
Electrical power generation.  
When there is also renewable generation, mainly, because the heat and electricity systems do not cooperate, such power to heat schemes, represent a possible solution to this problem.  
For instance, combined heat and power plants can be controlled.  
Also in response to the electricity demand.  
Anytime there is renewable generation.  
Ian, which is clean and cheap electricity.  
The CHP plant can be wrapped down or Switched Off and required heat can be produced by using the electrical electrical heat pump.  
This is also desirable in terms of emissions, since clean electricity, instead of gas can be used for heating.  
And alternative option for decarbonizing, the heat sector is power to gas.  
Technology to convert electricity.  
For instance, access Renewable Power Generation into gas or other fuel.  
This could help flattening the early load profile and reduce the seasonal impact.  
We have discussed before the excess Renewable Power Generation occurring during summer can be converted into Gasps by using this power to gas technology and stored taking advantage of the already existing gas Network infrastructure.  
The store gas can be used during winter to meet the higher heat demand, of course, a cost-benefit analysis of power to gas technology which takes into account.  
The efficiency loss due to the various energy conversion, processes and investment cost can help assess.  
And it can be convenient to use this technology.  
We have seen that he represents a major contribution to energy consumption and Emissions, particularly in the domestic sector power to heat schemes and power to gas technology at flexibility to the electrical grid.  
Also through the interaction with other energy sectors, like, heat and gas.  
They can support higher penetration of variable renewable generation and mitigate the additional stress put on the electrical grid.  
Grid coming from the new load slight, heat pumps.  
Thank you.

## 2.5	Electrification of transport
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the sixth video of the section 2.  
This video describes the main Technologies of electric vehicles and the challenges and opportunities of electrification of transport.  
As shown in this Sankey diagram of the energy flows in the United Kingdom in 2016, the transport sector shares a large portion of the energy use which nowadays mainly comes from Petrol and Diesel a smart future electricity grid needs to cope with new loads like the electric vehicles whose um, utilization is increasing and which can help the carbonizing the transport sector.  
These are the 3 main Technologies of electric vehicles battery electric behaviors, which run all your electricity and are recharged by plugging into the grid.  
Fuel cell powered electric vehicles, which use non-frost fuels such as hydrogen to power an electric motor.  
Fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen or air to sustain the chemical reaction.  
The fuel cell is supplied with hydrogen either coming from pre-filled onboard tanks or produce on board through dedicated fuel processors using for example gasoline.  
the last technology of electric vehicles refers to hybrid electric vehicles, which combine a conventional internal combustion engine propulsion system with an electric propulsion system and can switch between electricity and fossil fuels but features smaller batteries that charge while driving Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are also recharged by plugging into the grid but can switch between electricity and fossil fuels.  
Let's us focus on battery electric vehicles which use on electricity and let us Define and transport related emission factor to assess their environmental impact You will analyze their impact on electricity network from a technical perspective in the last 3 sections of unit 5.  
Grams of CO2 emitted per each kilometer is a metric typical for cars.  
For alternative transport like buses persons are to be included in the metric.  
So the most suitable metric is grams of CO2 emitted per each kilometer and per each person.  
A metric for comparing the environmental impact of different Vehicles.  
Also in comparison with other sectors is again grams of CO2 emitted per each kilometer or to consider the energy needed to power the car and then considering the CO2 content in that amount of energy.  
This is a little bit more complicated because the carbon content in a kilowatt hour of electricity depends on the time.  
It is generated since it come it can come from cold plants or from Winter binds.  
For instance.  
This is a key aspect when assessing the decarbonization of the transport sector through electric vehicles in order to be effective clean energy must be used to power the vehicles which implies that low carbon Technologies must be increasingly embedded into the electricity grid.  
Further if the electric vehicle is charged during peak times.  
It is more likely that the carbon content in the use electricity is higher than the 1 at of big times.  
This is something to consider when designing more intelligent charging shuling strategies.  
This light shows 4 figures comparing the use of internal combustion engine cars and low medium and high range electric vehicles in 4 different countries, France United States, India and China convert in terms of average emission factors.  
The range of an electric vehicle is the distance 1 uh can travel on pure electric power before the battery requires a recharge.  
The authors of this study in 2011 considered the average over 1 year and for power generation, we can see that the numbers are really different from 1 country to the other and this is because France for instance produces electricity mainly by using nuclear plants, which have low emissions while India and China mainly use uh coal plants.  
Further the numbers change also according to the range of the EBA call since changing the range implies to increase the battery size.  
By looking at these figures we can see that in 2011 using electric vehicles in France made a significant difference in terms of carbon emissions while in China for instance standard internal combustion engine cars had lower emissions than small range electric vehicles.  
The figures on this light can just give you an idea of the possible impact of electric vehicles on the network.  
You will investigate this aspect into detail in the last 3 sections of the unit.  
We can notice how the peak load can change if people use electrical Vehicles.  
The blue curve is the demand profile without electric vehicles.  
The red curve gives the total demand including the electric vehicles.  
The figure of on the left side, uh shows the new Peak load resulting from the charging of electric vehicles in commercial areas which occurs in the morning when people arrive at work and charge their electric cars.  
In the figure on the right side, we can see that the new Peak load occurs in the evening in residential areas when people arrive home from work and charge cars.  
We speak demand is quite predictable on an aggregated level but it put anyway considerable stress upon the distribution Network infrastructure since locally this new Peak must be effectively managed.  
Of course additional generation capacity might be needed but electric vehicles can also be considered as mobile storage systems and their flexibility Source can be more efficiently used and optimized.  
In this slide, there is an example to show how this flexibility Source could be utilized for instance to compensate for the variability of the renewable generation.  
A 2 buses simple system is the depicted with 2 lines at 100 megawatt of capacity and wind and solar generation.  
The average Peak demand without electric vehicles on a summer day is 100 megawatt on a summer night is 50 megawatt.  
In summer electric vehicles can be charged during the day when there is enough solar generation, but the charging can be moved to the night on this when there is not enough solar generation in order to use the cheaper generating units a as much as possible the average Peak demand without electric vehicles on a winter day is instead 150 megawatt on a winter night is 75 megawatts.  
During the winter demand during the day is quite high and in the night is smaller.  
So it might be possible to use some wind generation and some power from the cheaper generation Unit A and charge the cars overnight.  
This is just to give you an idea of the additional flexibility introduced by electric vehicles as mobile storage devices.  
and possible different uses of this we will discuss this more in Section 3 how much additional generation capacity we need for long-term Security in the presence of these new electric loads and how to quantify their impact on uncertainty and resource are still open questions being investigated.  
We have banned discussed the need to cope with additional loads to the carbonize the transport sector and that this new loads post challenges, but also opportunities to the operation of a smart grid because they add flexibility and their use can be coordinated with the renewable generation to support the penetration of variable renewable generation.  
Another possible option to decarbonize transport is to use fuel cell powered electric vehicles and integrate these with power to gas technology and produce hydrogen from electricity for instance from a surplus of electric power because of wind generation during off peak times which would be curtail and then wasted.  
Otherwise of course costs of additional equipment required and efficiency losses must be also taken into account when analyzing the cost benefit of this option.  
Thank you.

## 2.6	Efficiencies and emission factors
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio.  
And this is the eighth video of section 2.  
The video explains how to model low-carbon Technologies and generally power plants through efficiencies and emission factors.  
This can give you an idea of how to incorporate low carbon Technologies and storage systems into models for operation optimization of future Power Systems.  
Power plants can be easily modeled in terms of efficiency and emission factors in order to assess different generation systems.  
The efficiency is generally the ratio of power or energy output to power or energy input.  
The environmental impact of power plants can be assessed through emission factors, which account for the amount of carbon content contained in the amount of fuel burnt to produce the required amount of electricity.  
In case of thermal power plants, the electrical efficiency is defined as the ratio of electricity to fuel which is the input.  
As to gas bowler a thermal efficiency is defined since the output is Heat and the input is gas or other fuel.  
The fuel related emission Factor measured in grams per kilowatt hour is the amount of carbon content in that amount of fuel grams of CO2 emitted when burning 1 kilowatt hour of fuel from the table we can see realistic emission factors of typical fuels coal is the fuel emitting more carbon dioxide when burned we can Define the emission Factor as the ratio between the mass of CO2 emitted to produce the generic useful energy output X and the useful output X.  
X is the useful energy which can be thermal energy electrical energy cooling energy and so on.  
In order to compute output related emission factors where the output is the useful energy.  
We are interested in the emission factor of the input used to produce that output is to be divided by efficiency, which is the ratio of output to input.  
So for instance to calculate the electricity related emission factor of a thermal power plant, which is grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour of electricity generated the emission factor of the fuel burned to generate 1 kilowatt hour of electricity is to be divided by the efficiency of the plant.  
This table shows the electricity related emission factors of the plants Illustrated before.  
Let us compare oil based and core based plants to highlight the important role of the efficiency.  
Call which is the fuel input for coal plants has higher carbon content than oil on the other hand oil plants are less efficient than coal plants, which entails that more fuel is to be burned to generate 1 kilowatt hour of electricity.  
So the electricity related emission factor of oil plants is higher than the 1 of coal plants.  
Electricity can be also generated through co-generation combined heat and power plants which are more efficient since they embed recovery over heat.  
Otherwise discard from the thermodynamic cycle.  
Combined heat and power plants generate both electricity and heat their overall Energy Efficiency is around 80 90% And the emissions are generally lower than the ones from conventional thermal plants.  
Considering the 2 use energy outputs electricity and heat it is possible to Define 2 efficiency for the co-generation production of the 2 outputs the electrical efficiency defined as the ratio of electrical energy generated to the fuel input and the thermal efficiency defined as the ratio of the heat heat to the same fuel input.  
We can further Define the overall efficiency of a cogeneration system.  
We Define the energy utilization of factor in case of simultaneous production of the 2 forms of energy electricity and heat which is the sum of the 2 energy outputs divided by the fuel input.  
Code generation systems can be assessed in terms of the energy use and compared with separate production systems.  
Systems where electricity and heat are generated through completely decoupled and separate power plants for instance a core plants and a gas boiler with their separate electrical and thermal efficiencies denoted by EA ESP and EA tsp, respectively in the slide.  
The fuel energy saving Ratio or primary energy saving of the cogeneration system with respect to the separate production system is computed as shown in the slide the relative primary energy saving is generally defined as percentage of fuel use by the cogeneration system to the fuel use by the separate production system.  
A good generation system does not necessarily leads to energy and emission saving with respect to a separate production system.  
It depends on the specific plants use and their efficiencies in the last video of this section.  
I will illustrate how to assess different generation systems by using Sankey diagrams efficiencies and emission factors.  
A natural extension of co-generation is 3 generation where electricity heat and cooling are produced since in summer.  
There could be demand for cooling.  
3 generation can be more efficient and with a higher utilization factor of co-generation since it can be used both in Winter and in summer.  
Cooling is generating through an absorption Chiller which uses part of the recovered heat to generate Cooling.  
In case of 3 generation the same approach used for co-generation can be applied and we can defy 3 efficiencies the electrical the thermal and the cooling 1 which is the ratio of cooling energy to the same fuel input.  
Here I would just like to mention that efficiency is a very important concept also for storage systems and it can be used also to model electric storage systems.  
The main difference is that we have Dynamics to account for intertemporal Behavior.  
since the state of charge of the storage unit at a given point in time for instance now depends on the state of charge at a previous point in time, for example 1 hour before This is a typical discrete time model of an electrical storage unit.  
Where X of k + 1 denotes the energy level in the storage at time k + 1 which depends on the energy level at time K multiplied by a factor Alpha accounting for the energy degradation with time plus or minus the charge or discharge power depending if the storage is it charging or discharging mode? The charging or discharging efficiency account for the energy losses during the charging or discharging process.  
The 2 operating modes require an integer variable Delta in the slide taking only 0 or 1 as values to be correctly modeled.  
To recap we have seen how power plants including conventional and low carbon Technologies can be simply modeled in terms of efficiency and emission factors to assess their energy and environmental performance.  
Efficiencies can be used to model electrical storage systems as well.  
Variable renewable generation can be more correctly modeled as classic processes or any way in a probabilistic manner.  
Now we will be able to quantify the energy and environmental benefits of several different generation Technologies.  
Thank you for listening.

# 3	Week 3
## 3.1	Definition of flexibility
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio and welcome to the first video of Section 3.  
In this video I will present what is meant by a flexibility and describe how it can support penetration of renewable energy sources.  
Flexibility is the capability of a power system to maintain reliable Supply by modifying production or consumption in the face of rapid and large imbalances such as unpredictable fluctuations in the demand or invariable generation in a cost-effective manner.  
Flexibility has always been present in Power Systems since it has always been required varying Supply to meet consumer demand in a low-carbon system where generation and demand as well are more variable and efficient system and a maximized asset utilization can only be achieved where Supply and consumption of energy is more flexible.  
The value of flexibility has largely gone unnoticed since traditionally the provision of electricity measured as energy has been rewarded.  
more recently concerns over Peak capacity provision have prompted several countries to adopt capacity mechanisms, which reward power in the figure on the left side a simple example of generations schedule is depicted.  
The load profile is represented by the blue line.  
Without win generation.  
The nuclear plant is dispatched first, then call gas and hydro plants are utilized to cover the demand during Peaks.  
In the figure on the right side when wind generation is available.  
We can notice how the net demand profile which is demand minus.  
The wind generation is much more variable and unpredictable as well as generation.  
This leads to several issues.  
For instance when the load is low we can see that even if only the nuclear plant is dispatched.  
There is an excess generation and since nuclear is not flexible.  
The only solution is to curtail and then waste clean wind generation.  
Another solution is to shed load or store it if possible and we will discuss the month flexibility in the last videos of the section.  
Another issue is the requirement of very quick down and up ramps which requires flexible plans able to react fast including plants committed to provide Reserve which cannot be nuclear or cold plants for instance because they are not flexible.  
We can also notice a further issue which is the lower utilization factor of Pickers such as hydro plants in this case.  
The well-known duck curve is shown in this Slide the California independent system operator performed a detailed analysis of every day of the year from 2012 to 2020 to understand changing a grid conditions with increasingly higher solar generation.  
During the day when there is high solar generation.  
The net load is low and there is over generation the net load increases significantly when there is not some light net load is the difference between forecasted load and expected electricity production from variable generation resources.  
In certain times of the year in the summer for instance these curves produce a belly shape in the mid-afternoon that quickly ramps up to produce a curve similar to the neck of a duck.  
Several conditions emerge that will require specific resource operational capabilities such as short steep ramps, which means that the system operator must bring on or shut down generational resources to meet an increasing or decreasing electricity demand quickly over short period of time.  
Over Supply risk, which means that more electricity supplied than is needed to satisfy real-time electricity requirements and decrease frequency response, which means that less resources are available to automatically adjust electricity production to maintain grid reliability.  
To maintain reliability the system operator must continuously match the demand for electricity with the supply on a second bicycle basis.  
Historically, this was performed by controlling conventional thermal power plants, but with a growing penetration of renewable generation a generation into both transmission and distribution networks.  
There are higher levels of non-controllable variable generation.  
As well as demand.  
To ensure reliability under changing grid conditions the system operator needs Resources with the ramping flexibility and the ability to start and stop multiple times per day which are usually usually more expensive generation units, like open cycle gas turbines.  
When the over generation occurs renewable generation may need to be curtailed which would be a missed opportunity to use clean power at minimal marginal cost.  
Energy Efficiency and generally demand side management and storage is represent.  
Very promising solutions to these issues the use of Energy Efficiency and other strategies such as the man responds storage are described as teaching the duct to fly.  
We will discuss this further in the last videos of deception.  
Using new and existing forms of flexibility efficiently is the key to responding to the challenges of a changing system given the carbon emission targets and expected increase in or in the overall demand for electricity the traditional approach of investing to increase Peak capacity of generation and networks infrastructure is not longer sustainable.  
In fact, this would mean having a lot of excess generation capacity during most of the day and long periods of the year.  
This is expensive and inefficient flexibility can reduce the need for expensive and carbon-intensive peaking plants and can reduce Network costs by avoiding on the fairing reinforcement enable cheaper and more timely connections and enabling more efficient resolution of network issues.  
Flexibility is also needed to improve the asset utilization achieve a more flattened demand profile maximize the use of Cheaper assets.  
New types of flexibility are needed and we have to take the opportunities for offered by information technology to deliver smart flexible Energy Systems.  
of course all comes at a cost the deployment costs of new technologies and ICT must be taken into account.  
You will discuss this aspect in the last 3 sections of the unit.  
These figures show how flexibility can help manage the electricity system.  
Flexibility sources can be optimally coordinated and managed too.  
For example shave the peak load reduce or increase the net demand when required to match the supply and integrate Renewable Power Generation as much as possible shift the load or reaching a smoother load profile, which the grid operator can more easily predict and meet.  
These actions can be taken in response to a price or electronic signal for instance to help manage a system for or to match the man with Supply from renewable sources.  
There are 2 main types of flexibility price flexibility which occurs when any part varies their their demand or generation in response to the price of energy and network use at a particular time and or location.  
Contracted flexibility which occurs when parties trade and directly contract with 1 another to procure flexibility and for which an agreed payment is made.  
As shown in this figure on the left side in order to be flexible, the future system should feature an efficient and sustainable mix of generation sources both at transmission and distribution level.  
It should feature an increase and efficient deployment of demand side responds when consumers can choose to change their patterns of consumption in response to Market signals in order to save energy costs or increase their comfort.  
The future power system should also enable new Technical and Commercial structures to support more efficient provision of flexibility in particular in the figure third part aggregation is included aggregators act as third-party intermediaries between the providers of flexibility and the network operators who rely on the service to manage loads and flows on their systems.  
To recap flexibility is not a new requirement.  
But in a smart grid flexibility plays a more important role and new sources of flexibility are required and are to be optimally managed.  
Thank you.

## 3.2	Sources of flexibility in a smart grid
Hi, I'm Alessandra Parisian and welcome to the second video of Section 3.  
In this video, I will briefly describe the main sources of flexibility in a smart Grid in the smarter grid not only in flexible generation such as nuclear and coal plants and inelastic demand are included but also additional resources that contribute to increase the grid flexibility such as Dispatchable distributed power plants, demand-side management and response energy storage facilities and interconnection with other networks and energy markets, the easy to control.  
Large scale, centralized power stations are rapidly, being displaced by new smaller distributed, and harder to control renewable generators, among more flexible generation and low-carbon sources, which are You to be increasingly utilized in a smart grid.  
There are combined cycle, gas turbines, and combined heat and power.  
Plant CHP.  
New sources of flexibility, will be more and more employed in a smart grid.  
Such as storage, not just traditional pumped Hydro facilities but also other Technologies like battery storage systems flywheels ultracapacitors the months Idris Spawns, including through aggregators.  
Besides with increased use of ICT and control Technologies, it would be possible to enable greater aggregation of distributed resources across the system and active management of distribution networks, as well as new opportunities for consumers on home manage energy management.  
Such as smart, tariffs, smart appliances, and electric vehicles, improving renewable, generation, forecasting, and creating water.  
Balancing areas can be see, also allows for more flexibility.  
In fact, for instance, if more interconnection capacity is available across large areas United Kingdom can take advantage of wind generation in Ireland.  
This would allow diversifying renewable generation.  
Also geographically and this improves its capacity.  
Credit this might need additional infrastructures.  
Of course, whose costs must be accounted for.  
For an alternative form of flexibility.  
Could be achieved by increasing the resolution of the market now it is usually 30 minutes or one hour.  
But at higher resolution such as five minutes could allow rescheduling rescheduling more frequently and making a better use of flexibility options.  
These new market range meant is considered in several countries such as Australia, also, I think the unit commitment problem differently including additional sources of uncertainty and adopting a stochastic approach to better compensate for these uncertainty, could help achieve a more flexible power system.  
Operation new technologies and Commercial structures will be available in a smart grid which can support more flexible operation.  
These new structures are mainly virtual power plants, macro blades.  
Aggregators and Energy service companies in particular micro grids and virtual power plants are two, approaches to aggregating grid resources to achieve particular goals because of virtual power plant or micro grid can be large enough to access the wholesale electricity Market.  
It can pass real-time also pricing signals to its internal sources loads and storage leading to more.  
In price signal response, a virtual power plant is an aggregation of energy generation resources that can be treated as a single larger generation resource from the grid operators perspective.  
These resources might not be geographically co-located and generally do not have the ability to operate independently from the Grid in general.  
A virtual power plant may use any combination of volt power sources, conventional power sources, energy storage, and distributed generators, a central controller, coordinates the resources so that they can be treated as a single resource from the grid.  
Operators perspective, virtual power plant operators can access or earn wholesale prices and pass them on the including resources without direct control movement from the grid operators.  
This allows more efficient Was of grid resources without complicating, utility operations.  
A micro grid is a portion of an electric grid that can disconnect from the main grid and operate, autonomously supplying its own load from internal power sources for some period of time.  
Microgrids are typically on the scale of a small town, your bun District or University, or commercial campus.  
A typical macroblade includes an intelligent switch to handle connection and disconnection.  
On the central grid, internal energy sources often, including energy storage and a micro grid controller, which decides, which energy resources to use at what times in order to balance load and generation.  
These micro grid controller might take into account predicted, load profile predictive power price profile predictive wind or solar power.  
Profiles predictive Heating, and Cooling.  
Needs if micro grid.  
It contains code generation, also, emissions, and other parameters.  
Aggregators combined and sell flexible load adjustments, and on-site generation from multiple consumer sites, which are predominantly commercial and Industrial.  
However, in the future more and more residential consumers are expected to participate in the market as flexibility providers and Energy Service Company is a company that provides comprehensive Energy Solutions to its customers including auditing read.  
Awning and implementing changes to the ways consumers, use energy with the aim to improve efficiency as men.  
Flexibility providers, we have Industrial and Commercial consumers, domestic consumers.  
Who could play an active role in providing flexibility such as thermal response, one, smart meters and other supporting Technologies are in place to enable it to enable consumer participation.  
Consumers will need adequate economic incentives, versus loss of comfort and new forms of contracts.  
It's me, flexibility providers.  
We also have energy storage providers since while pumped storage has historically, played a strong role in the power system, the potential of battery and other forms of storage to smooth variable generation or contribute to local balancing has.  
Not yet been fully realized distributed generation which can also provide flexibility creating opportunities to supply locally.  
And provide other services to Market actors aggregators, which could enable more flexibility by acting as intermediaries between multiple parties and could bridge.  
The gap between consumers and traditional Market, participants, As main flexibility users, we have instead suppliers which use flexibility to manage balance risks while these as so.  
So far been achieved primarily by buying and selling electricity.  
There is also scope for suppliers to act on the demand side by encouraging, their customers to shift or reduce their demand at peak times, distributed Network, operators and transmission Network.  
As well as system operators, which could use flexibility to the fur or avoid Investments support cheaper and more timely connections.  
Improve balancing services for a third and frequent management purposes, and for system.  
Security.  
And finally generators, which could use flexibility to balance their positions.  
Currently generators typically do this by changing the amount generated or the generation.  
They Rather than for instance, accessing storage devices.  
To summarize.  
We have learnt that new sources of flexibility are available in a smart grid and new technologies and Commercial structures can be used to improve power system.  
Operation, thank you.

## 3.3	Relevant generator parameters
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio and welcome to the third video of Section 3.  
In this video, I will introduce flexibility in the supply side and describe relevant generator parameters.  
Flexibility is commonly measured in terms of megawatts available for ramping up and down over time.  
In fact, when more power is required generators have to ramp up which requires them to be flexible as the need for power reduces flexibility is required again, this time to ramp down power the rate at which power changes in time is proportional to the scale of flexibility required.  
Load profiles have daily and seasonal components.  
Some response needs can be instantaneous such as sudden failure of a generator.  
The rate of change in net demand increases further with wind and solar generation.  
Over generation is 1 of the major challenges flexibility in the supply side requires some degree of redundancy or spare capacity the notice period can have an important bearing on the availability of different kinds of flexibility.  
Some forms of flexibility can be available at all times and on short notice others can increase their flexibility by taking Preparatory steps.  
For thermal generators, they could take a several hours or even days to start up from a cold state.  
Forecasting can help increase notice periods and could help provide greater flexibility at lower costs.  
The most critical generator parameters for flexibility are minimum stable generation ramp up and down rates minimum up and down times in flexible generators such as nuclear and cold plants have commonly High minimum and stable generation long minimum up and down times limited Ramp rates.  
This implies that they are not able to follow and respond to Sharp and unpredictable changes in the net load.  
During minimum load conditions because of this inflexible, but cheaper generators running free and clean renewable generation is to be curtailed.  
System level constraints relevant to flexibility are Power Balance since if the power system is already out of balance is much less flexible and Reserve since if spinning Reserve is required a certain number of plants Run Part loaded and cannot be switched off.  
So in case of wind generation, there might be over generation and cheaper and carbon-free electric power is wasted.  
Let us consider the simple example Illustrated in the previous section to show this.  
The figure illustrates a market sketch with 4 generators nuclear coal plants combined and opened cycle gas turbines.  
We consider 3 specific hours and respective demand levels at 3:00 a.m.  
11:00 a.m.  
And 6:00 p.m.  
The plants are dispatched according to their Merit orders, which is from the lowest to the highest marginal costs.  
Considered the scenario with 300 megawatt of variable generation from wind and solar plants.  
Without considering minimum up times of nuclear and coal plants of 24 hours and 5 hours respectively.  
We could integrate the whole renewable generation and use nuclear plant as marginal producer during minimum load condition as shown in the top figure.  
If we consider in minimum stable generation of 500 megawatts for the nuclear plant and Min minimum up times for the nuclear and coal plants.  
200 megawatt of clean and cheap generation has to be wasted at 3:00 a.m.  
As shown in the bottom figure.  
For higher wind penetration this problem becomes more frequent because on the 1 hand more reserved is required and on the other hand, there are larger amounts of wind energy to be accommodated.  
A crucial point a renewable generation integration is to ensure that wind generation output added to a flexible generation output is lower than the month in flexible generation output corresponds to the total generation that cannot be reduced due to plant technical limits and is composed by minimum output of mass run plants and minimum stable generation of synchronized plants providing spinning results.  
smart grid requires flexible resource capabilities to reliably operate in these conditions required characteristics of more flexible generation units include the ability to perform the following functions sustained upward and downward ramp respond for a defined period of time change Ram directions quickly react quickly and meet expected operating levels.  
Start with short notice from a zero or low electricity operating level.  
Start and stop multiple times per day and allow accurate forecasts of operating capability.  
This table shows some typical standard technical parameters of generators relevant to flexibility.  
Besides the hydro storage system the most flexible generation unit is the open cycle gas turbine, which is also 1 of the most expensive.  
The least flexible generation unit is the nuclear plant, which is 1 of the cheapest unit.  
And then it is the first to be dispatched according to the current market structure.  
Dispatching first inflexible units makes the overall system less flexible new plants ramp up better given as percentage of power increase with respect to the rated capacity per minute.  
variable renewable generation can also provide flexibility frequency support in the regulation Market requires a given type of a containment which is an operational change in wind turbine operation.  
The turbine is partially controllable at its operational characteristics can be modified so that the turbine generates less electricity than the 1 that would be generated given its rated capacity.  
Win turbines have inertia, which uh, then could be also used for providing inertia to the system from for primary and secondary frequency response.  
The main limited factors for inertial response from wind turbines are the extra heat due to the additional power generation and stress on mechanical components.  
There could be other opportunities such as coupling with storage systems.  
There are ongoing studies on this topics.  
To summarize we have seen that the most relevant parameters to flexibility in the supply side are Ramp rates and minimum up and down times generators with ramping flexibility and the ability to start and stop multiple times per day are needed however flexibility in the supply side comes at a cost.  
In fact flexibility requires some degree of redundancy or spare capacity which generally reduces plant efficiency or utilization.  
Thank you.

## 3.4	Benefits of flexible generation
Hi, I'm Alexandra parisio and welcome to the fourth video of Section 3.  
In this video, I will explain how flexibility in the supply side can be used to support the penetration of renewable sources.  
more flexible generation can support penetration of renewable generation and reduce curtailment improve asset utilization and power system reliability under changing grid conditions since flexible generation units have the capability to better adapt to variability in renewable generation and in the demand However, flexible units are usually more expensive the sides relying only on flexibility in the supply side would require some degree of redundancy or spare capacity, which is also expensive.  
We will see in the next videos that there are additional sources of flexibility in a smart grid to take advantage of Let us consider simple example from section 2 to show how more flexible units can support integration of renewable generation into the grid.  
We know that synchronized Reserve is provided by conventional power plants Run Part loaded with a consequent efficiency loss in the typical range between 10% and 20% in addition because of this generating units Running part loaded.  
Some other units will need to be brought onto the system to supply energy that was originally allocated to plants that are now running at reduced output.  
Useful wind power might have to be curtailed in the simultaneous event of high wind and low demand.  
We consider 26 gigawatts of installed wind capacity, but the expected power output is 12 gigawatts and the system operator as decided to schedule a 6.5 gigawatts of Reserve.  
So 50% of the expected output.  
The demand is 25 gigawatts.  
The inflexible generation capacity or mass run generation is 8.4 gigawatt.  
Combined cycle gas turbines are available to provide spinning Reserve.  
With 550 megawatts of rated power output and 300 megawatts as minimum stable generation.  
This means that each turbine can provide 250 megabytes of Reserve while running part loaded at its minimum stable generation.  
Standing Reserve is also available, which is provided by open cycle gas turbine up to 2 gigabytes.  
Sending Reserve is usually provided by more expensive but more flexible plans with for instance shorter startup times and higher Ramp rates.  
In this first scenario, we use only spinning Reserve provided by plants running part loaded synchronized with the grid.  
In order to provide the required 6.5 gigabytes of Reserve 26 combined cycle gas turbines are needed.  
This implies that 26 units provide 300 megawatt each and then produce a 7.8 gigabytes.  
In case the wind generation is equal to the expected 1 3.2 GB of clean and cheap generation must be curtailed.  
As an alternative to spinning reserve the balancing tasks can be supported by standing Reserve.  
Part of the reserve required to integrate 26 gigawatts of wind generation is now provided by standing Reserve open cycle gas turbines up to 2 gb.  
The remaining 4.5 GB will be provided by 18 combined cycle gas turbines spinning.  
The total available generation including the wind generation will now be 25.8 gigabytes with 800 megawatts Surplus to be quarter tail instead of 3.2 gigabytes.  
Thus a suitable combination of standing and spinning Reserve can increase the penetration of the variable renewable generation in the power system improve the asset utilization and reduce the amount of fossil fuel burnt.  
As pointed out over generation is 1 of the greatest challenges of the integration of variable renewable generation into the grid adapting the operation of more flexible generation units combined heat and power plants CHP plants to electricity demand could also add flexibility to the electricity grid.  
This is a power to hit scheme.  
We have seen in section 2 where there is a typical District heating system and large scale combined heat and power plant along with heat pumps and thermostat surges.  
Combined heat and power plants are usually driven by the heat demand.  
However, they also produce electricity CHP plants could be operated differently and compensate for the fluctuating input of Renewables based electricity to the grid to stabilize the network and support the balancing task.  
For instance combined heat and power plants can be controlled also in response to the electricity demand.  
Anytime there is renewable generation, which is clean and cheap electricity.  
The CHP plant can be ramped down or Switched Off and the required heat can be produced by using electrical heat pumps or supplied from the thermos storage facility.  
During times of high demand for electricity the CHP plant can be utilized and the heat produced beyond the customer's demand is stored in the storage system.  
the interaction between different energy sectors provides an additional source of flexibility in this slide a few real case studies are mentioned the bath Riverside case study refers to the solution of a CHP plant of 230 kilowatt electricity capacity which provides space Heating and hot water in combination with other Technologies, uh to 800 new homes via a district heating Network.  
The benefits of the CHP plant are reduction in carbon emissions of 55% and in energy of 34% in 1 year.  
The Lister Hospital case study is about a 1.4.  
Megawatt electricity CHP plant installed on a 480 bed District General Hospital in stem age.  
The use of a CHP plant led to an annual cost-saving of 0.65 million pounds and an annual carbon emission reduction of 20% The bosson scientific case study refers to 1 megawatt electricity CHP installation on the company side.  
Boston Scientific is a company in the health care sector.  
The CHP unit satisfy 33% of the total site electrical load and 78% of the site heating load.  
This simulation study shows potential benefit of CHP plants and additional flexibility in the supply side.  
As shown in the figure on the left side and interconnected micro grids 15 in this case study cooperate through an aggregator and share a combined heat and power plant.  
The micro grids are managed such that the overall running costs are minimized and the power exchanged with the electrical grid is also minimized.  
The use of the CHP plant is optimized considering both electrical and thermal demand.  
Each microgrid is connected to the distribution Network and equipped with a heat pump solar generation and the battery energy storage system as well as local energy management system.  
Shiftable loads are included such as washing machines dryers and dishwashers.  
A day in November in Sweden Stockholm is simulated.  
The figure on the right side shows the difference in the profiles of the power exchanged with the grid resulting from micro grids using the CHP plant and micro grids that do not cooperate and just optimize their local energy sources through the local energy management system.  
We can see that the use of the CHP plant is beneficial not only in terms of cost saving but also for the substantial reduction in the amount of energy exchanged with the grid.  
The micro grids are also able to provide electricity negative values in the figure over the afternoon usually times of peak load.  
To recap power system requires greater flexibility in order to support renewable source penetration into the electricity grid.  
Other sources of flexibility not only in the supply side as in traditional power systems are needed.  
I would just like to mention another aspect.  
New Market structures might be required to ensure that enough flexibility will be available in the future and that resources are incentivized to provide faster ramping capability and other flexibility attributes.  
Markets rewarding up and down ramp products are under development for instance in California where the penetration of solar generation is increasing.  
flexible ramping will be reserved in 1 period to meet possible ramps in future periods and will be dispatched on an economic basis when needed Thank you.Demand-side management failed
